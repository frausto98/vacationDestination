# vacationDestination

## Description:
We have built a hotel finder so that you can plan your next Vacation Destination. The application is a search engine where you can look up a location and find places to stay within that area. You can input very specific information such as: Check-in and -out dates, how many are staying, how many rooms, and the price. You can then choose between four hotel options, click the reserve button on one of them, and then you'll be directed to a brief summary page where you can leave your name and email.

We followed the following User Stories to develope the mental idea of what we will be using for our website and what our website will be all about:

    I want to search for a city to plan my location
        So that I can plan my vacation in my desired city

    I want to be directed to a page to clarify my parameters for the hotel
        So that I can choose the price, number of rooms,  check in and check out dates

    When I enter my parameters for the specified hotel
        Then I am presented with a list of hotels including the price

    When I choose the specified hotel
        Then I am directed to a confirmation page to input my name and email information

    I want to be able to enter my email address and name
        So that I can receive I confirmation for my reservation



This application was put together thanks to the use of Bulma.io, Unsplash API, TripAdivsor API, and Animejs API.

    Bulma.io (https://bulma.io) is a CSS Framework used to help structure and style your HTMls, ALL from your HTML itself! Bulma helped deliver the ideas to structure the application the way you see it today.

## Installation:
No installation needed, simply visit the deployed website at: https://frausto98.github.io/vacationDestination

## Usage:
To use, simply input your location, just a city name. You'll then be directed to select dates from a drop down, input how many rooms needed, how many adults, and then input the minimun and maximum prices. Then, a choice of four hotels will pop up, where you must select one to reserve, then you'll be directed to a summary page. There you will input your name and email to be contacted (not really).
